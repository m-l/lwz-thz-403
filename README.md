## Introduction

This is a custom Home Assistant integration for connecting Stiebel Eltron LWZ or Tecalor THZ heat pumps to Home Assistant. The integration enables comprehensive monitoring and control of your heat pump system directly from your Home Assistant instance.

The integration communicates with the heat pump using the serial protocol, supporting both direct USB connections and network-based serial connections (via ser2net). This allows flexible deployment options depending on your home automation setup.

Parts of this software have been developed by the help of AI.

**Origin**: This integration is based on the FHEM-Module developed by Immi, adapted for Home Assistant with modern async architecture and full UI configuration support.

**v0.4** adds climate entities (HC1, HC2, DHW), diverter valve motor control, compressor/booster runtime sensors, a block-refresh service, and a range of reliability and correctness improvements. See [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) for details.

## Features

### Currently Implemented

- ✅ **Full UI Configuration**: Easy setup through Home Assistant's integration interface — no YAML configuration required
- ✅ **Connection Options**: Support for both USB serial and network (ser2net) connections
- ✅ **Sensor Platform**: Monitor temperatures, pressures, operating states, runtime hours, and more
- ✅ **Switch Platform**: Control heat pump functions on/off
- ✅ **Number Platform**: Adjust numeric settings and parameters
- ✅ **Select Platform**: Choose between predefined options — including **passive cooling mode** (firmware 4.39/5.39)

- ✅ **Services**: `thz.read_raw_register`, `thz.refresh_block`, and `thz.set_diverter_valve`

### Climate Entities

Three climate entities are automatically created when the required data blocks are available:

| Entity | Source block | Supports |
|--------|-------------|---------|
| Heating Circuit 1 | `pxxF4` | Temperature setpoint, HVAC mode, preset (comfort/sleep/away), fan mode |
| Heating Circuit 2 | `pxxF5` | Temperature setpoint, HVAC mode, preset — created only when HC2 is configured |
| Domestic Hot Water | `pxxF3` | Temperature setpoint, HVAC mode |

HC1 also exposes **HVAC action** (heating / cooling / idle) and optional **cooling mode** when the device supports active cooling.

### Services

#### `thz.read_raw_register`
Read any raw register block directly from the heat pump and return the hex dump. Useful for firmware research and debugging. See [docs/read-raw-register-service.md](docs/read-raw-register-service.md) for full documentation.

#### `thz.refresh_block`
Force an immediate re-read of a specific coordinator block without waiting for the next poll interval. Accepts any block name form (`"FB"`, `"pxxFB"`, `"0xFB"`). Returns `{success, block}`.

```yaml
service: thz.refresh_block
data:
  block: "FB"
```

#### `thz.set_diverter_valve`
Manual control of the 3-way diverter valve motor. Both `heating` and `dhw` directions are guarded by the `diverterValve` status bit in `pxxF2` — the command is refused if the heat pump is currently pressurising the opposite circuit. After 3 seconds the motor is automatically stopped and the stop is verified by reading back both motor registers.

```yaml
service: thz.set_diverter_valve
data:
  position: "dhw"   # heating | dhw | off
```

⚠️ Only use this service if you have a manually-controlled 3-way valve and understand the risk of incorrect actuation.

### Entity Visibility Tiers

To provide a cleaner initial setup experience, some less-commonly-needed entity
types start out disabled:

- **HC2 (Heating Circuit 2) entities**: Only needed if you have a second heating circuit installed
- **Time plan/programme entities**: Advanced schedule configuration entities (`programDHW_*`, `programHC1_*`, `programHC2_*`)
- **Advanced technical parameters**: Parameters like gradient, hysteresis, integral components (typically p13 and higher)

An **Entity Visibility** option (set during initial setup, or changed anytime
via **Reconfigure**) controls how many of these start out enabled:

| Tier | Behavior |
|------|----------|
| `Default` | Hides HC2, schedules, and advanced parameters (the entity list above) |
| `Extended` | Enables HC2 and advanced parameters; schedules stay hidden |
| `All` | Enables everything, including schedules |

Changing this option later via **Reconfigure** is retroactive: it bulk
enables/disables the matching entities on your existing install, so you
don't need to re-add the integration or click through entities one by one.
It never touches an entity you've manually enabled or disabled yourself.

Individual entities can always be re-enabled or hidden by hand via
**Settings → Devices & Services → THZ → device → Show disabled entities**,
regardless of the chosen tier.

### Entity ID Naming Style

An **Entity ID Style** option (also set during initial setup or via
Reconfigure) controls how `entity_id`s are generated for newly created
entities: `Default` uses this integration's own descriptive naming, while
`FHEM/technical` derives the `entity_id` from the raw FHEM/Stiebel Eltron
register field name instead (e.g. `dhwPump`, `p01RoomTempDayHC1`) — handy if
you're porting dashboards or automations from FHEM. This only affects the
`entity_id`; the displayed friendly name is unchanged either way, and it only
applies to entities created from that point on — it does not rename entities
that already exist.

### COP (Coefficient of Performance) Sensors

For firmware versions that support energy monitoring (e.g., 4.39), the integration automatically provides COP sensors:

- **Current COP**: Real-time COP based on instantaneous power measurements
- **Daily COP DHW / Heating / Total**
- **Lifetime COP DHW / Heating / Total**

COP = Heat Output ÷ Electrical Input. A COP of 3.0 means 3 kW of heat for every 1 kW of electricity consumed.

### Runtime Hours (firmware 4.39 / 5.39)

The `sHistory` block (command `09`) provides cumulative operating hours for the compressor and booster heaters:

- `compressor_runtime_heating` — compressor hours in heating mode
- `compressor_runtime_cooling` — compressor hours in cooling mode
- `compressor_runtime_dhw` — compressor hours in DHW mode
- `booster_runtime_dhw` — booster heater hours for DHW
- `booster_runtime_heating` — booster heater hours for heating

### Passive Cooling (firmware 4.39 / 5.39)

A **Passive Cooling** select entity controls the passive cooling mode:

| Mode | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `off` | Passive cooling disabled |
| `exhaust_air` | Cool via exhaust air only |
| `supply_air` | Cool via supply air only |
| `bypass` | Bypass mode |
| `sommerkassette` | Summer cassette mode |

A corresponding energy sensor `sCoolHCTotal` tracks total passive cooling energy on firmware 5.39.

### Diagnostics

The integration supports Home Assistant's built-in diagnostics download:

1. Go to **Settings** → **Devices & Services** → **THZ**
2. Click on your heat pump device
3. Click **Download Diagnostics**

The report includes firmware version, connection status, coordinator last-update times, and redacted hex dumps of all currently-polled register blocks.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Home Assistant (version 2021.12 or newer recommended)
- USB-to-serial adapter or ser2net server for network connection
- Physical access to your heat pump's serial interface

### Option 1: HACS (Recommended)

1. Ensure [HACS](https://hacs.xyz/) is installed in your Home Assistant instance
2. Open HACS → **Integrations** → three-dot menu → **Custom repositories**
3. Add `https://github.com/bigbadoooff/thz` as a custom repository with category **Integration**
4. Search for "Stiebel Eltron LWZ / Tecalor THZ" and click **Download**
5. Restart Home Assistant

### Option 2: Manual Installation

1. Download the latest release from the [releases page](https://github.com/bigbadoooff/thz/releases)
2. Copy the `thz` folder to `<config_dir>/custom_components/thz/`
3. Restart Home Assistant

### Configuration

1. Go to **Settings** → **Devices & Services** → **+ ADD INTEGRATION**
2. Search for **"Stiebel Eltron LWZ / Tecalor THZ Integration"**
3. Choose your connection type (USB or Network/ser2net) and follow the wizard

## Troubleshooting

### USB connection stops working after host reboot

If you are using USB and another application (e.g., FHEM) also accesses the serial port, it may grab the device before Home Assistant on startup, causing "Handshake 1 failed" errors. Disable the THZ device in FHEM (or whichever application is competing) and restart the Home Assistant container.

If HA is running in Docker and the device was not enumerated when the container started, restart the container after the USB adapter appears: `docker restart homeassistant`.

### Integration does not create entities

Check HA logs for `thz` entries. Common causes:
- Firmware version not detected (empty firmware string) — the integration falls back to a default map but some blocks may be empty
- Block not supported on the device — blocks returning no data are skipped silently

Use `thz.read_raw_register` to verify that a specific block returns data on your device.
