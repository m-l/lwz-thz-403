"""Constants for the THZ integration.

This module defines configuration keys, default values, and protocol-specific
byte markers used for communication with THZ devices.

Constants:
    DOMAIN: The domain name for the THZ integration.
    SERIAL_PORT: Default serial port for USB connection.
    TIMEOUT: Default timeout value for communication.
    DATALINKESCAPE: Byte value for Data Link Escape (DLE) in protocol.
    STARTOFTEXT: Byte value for Start of Text (STX) in protocol.
    ENDOFTEXT: Byte value for End of Text (ETX) in protocol.
    CONF_CONNECTION_TYPE: Configuration key for connection type.
    CONNECTION_USB: Value representing USB connection type.
    CONNECTION_IP: Value representing IP connection type.
    DEFAULT_BAUDRATE: Default baud rate for serial communication.
    DEFAULT_PORT: Default port for IP connection.
    DEFAULT_UPDATE_INTERVAL: Default update interval in seconds.
    DEFAULT_WRITE_INTERVAL: Default update interval for write entities in seconds.

# auto-detection lands on an unlisted firmware string (e.g. an LWZ 403
# reporting "438" instead of "439"), or when a user wants a specific profile
# such as the technician variant independent of the raw detected value.

# Entity ID naming style (config-flow "entity_id_style" field).

# (unchanged behaviour). "fhem" instead derives the entity_id from the RAW
# internal register-map/parameter name -- which, for the large majority of
# entries, IS already FHEM's own 00_THZ.pm field name or Stiebel Eltron's
# official parameter number (e.g. "dhwPump", "collectorTemp",
# "p01RoomTempDayHC1") since this integration was ported from those same
# tables -- run through a simple camelCase->snake_case slug (see
# entity_id_style.py). This is purely cosmetic: it only ever changes HA's
# *suggested* entity_id for a BRAND NEW entity (via _attr_suggested_object_id)
# and never touches unique_id or the displayed friendly name, so switching it
# does not rename or break any entity that already exists in the registry.
# Intended to make dashboards/automations ported from FHEM easier to read
# for FHEM users migrating to this integration.

# Entity visibility tier (config-flow "entity_visibility" field).
# Controls how many entities are enabled-by-default at creation time, to
# avoid the tedium of enabling dozens of individually-disabled entities by
# hand. Three tiers, from fewest to most entities enabled:
#   "default"  - hides HC2 entities, schedule/program entities, and advanced
#                technical parameters (p13+, hysteresis, gradient, booster
#                timing, etc.) -- this integration's long-standing behaviour.
#   "extended" - enables everything EXCEPT schedule/program entities (there
#                are ~120+ of these per firmware, one per day-of-week/slot
#                combination, which is what makes them "lengthy").
#   "all"      - enables every entity, including schedules.
# Selectable at initial setup and, unlike entity_id_style/firmware_override,
# ALSO retroactively reconciles the entity registry when changed later via
# Reconfigure (see __init__.py's _async_apply_entity_visibility_tier) --
# entities the integration previously disabled to match an older tier get
# re-enabled (or newly disabled) to match the new one. An entity a user has
# manually toggled by hand is left alone either way.
